# Avalonia + Native AOT migration

Status: complete test implementation on `codex/avalonia-aot`; do not merge into `main` or publish as a stable release before .NET 11 GA.

Version: `1.3.0-preview.8`
Runtime: .NET 11 Preview 7
UI framework: Avalonia 12.1.2
Production baseline: WPF v1.1.9 on `main`

## Result

The test branch now contains the complete Alchemy Stars desktop workflow rather than a migration shell:

- create, open, save and save-as legacy-compatible `.aprj` projects;
- add, edit, reorder and remove view-hand, weapon and attachment model parts;
- add base animations, optional hand poses and ordered Normal/Additive/Gesture/GesturePose layers;
- configure left/right IK, frame rate, output names and an explicitly selected output folder;
- export full-scene or animation-only CAST, FBX, SMD and SEAnim through the existing proven conversion implementation;
- choose full or relevant-bones-only baking, old Call of Duty compatibility, prefixes and suffixes;
- remember per-purpose file-browser locations and follow system, Chinese or English UI language;
- use file browsers, editable/pasteable paths, direct path drops, list drop zones and blank-area context menus;
- keep progress, success and error feedback centered inside the owning window;
- display the actual merged CAST with clay-shaded skinning, frame playback/scrubbing, orbit/zoom and skeleton-only support.

New animation output folders stay blank. The engine also rejects an output that resolves to any model, animation, pose or layer input, so a same-named export cannot overwrite source data.

## Architecture

```

The UI layer owns presentation, localization, file pickers and drag/drop. The engine owns skeleton identity, model composition, animation sampling, IK, validation and output formats. Legacy JSON uses source-generated `System.Text.Json` metadata, including the old `$id` / `$values` shape, so Native AOT does not depend on runtime reflection.

## Accessibility and visual behavior

- The minimum supported window is 900 × 600 DIP; each page scrolls vertically without horizontal clipping.
- The main shell adapts the supplied Beutl editor reference into a compact activity rail, project breadcrumb, asset library, composition canvas, functional animation-layer tracks, property inspector and 24 DIP full-width status strip. The 48 DIP activity rail, full-width lower layer area, resizable dividers and flat collapsible inspector follow the supplied reference.
- Primary actions retain at least 44 DIP command targets and visible focus rings. Icon-only navigation has localized tooltips and UI Automation names, with the page title visible in the breadcrumb.
- Icon-only toolbar commands use 24 DIP fixed canvases with inset rounded strokes, localized tooltips and UI Automation names.
- `Ctrl+O`, `Ctrl+S`, `Ctrl+Shift+S`, `Ctrl+E` and `Esc` cover project/export/dialog actions.
- Every drag or reorder workflow also has a file-browser, context-menu or button alternative.
- Windows UI Automation checks the published native executable for required names, keyboard focus, 44 × 44 key targets and initial dialog focus.
- The About icon is displayed inside a padded 112 × 112 region and is not clipped.
- No decorative animation is used; CAST playback is explicitly user-controlled and pauses when leaving the preview pages or opening a dialog.

## Verification

Completed on 2026-09-06:

- Release solution build: 0 warnings and 0 errors, excluding the expected preview-support notice.
- Acceptance suite: all 32 checks passed, including CAST, animation-only CAST, selective baking, SMD, Maya-backed FBX, the workspace store and source-overwrite prevention.
- Native AOT self-test, real Win32 startup, Windows UI Automation and four-page off-screen rendering: passed.
- Native AOT standard `HawkSprint.aprj` export: passed.
- CAST preview regression: visible geometry, distinct sampled frames, deterministic reverse scrubbing and unchanged input SHA-256; animation-only files also pass using the canonical project's matching skeleton. Preview uses a separate scene and does not alter the export pipeline.
- Native AOT and managed Hawk CAST outputs are byte-identical: SHA-256 `DB5940259349C1952E2049C27D55853B0A26A94C8AD30E8730B122C372287C81`.
- The clean `win-x64` publish is 7 files / 38.47 MiB (40,341,209 bytes). The application executable is 21,326,848 bytes; PDB files are rejected.

Run the complete native verification with the pinned preview SDK:

```powershell
./scripts/verify-avalonia-aot.ps1
```

The standard-project path can also be exercised directly:

```powershell
./output/avalonia-aot-preview8/AlchemyStars.Avalonia.exe --project-smoke ./fork/AlchemyStars/Example/Hawk/HawkSprint.aprj <output-folder>
```

## Native AOT notes

- Avalonia 12.1.2 currently emits two DirectComposition ILC diagnostics about non-blittable `bool` callbacks. Real Win32 startup, rendering and UI Automation pass; those executable checks remain release gates.
- Runtime assets use explicit `avares://` URIs and compiled bindings so trimming preserves the required UI metadata.
- The published app is self-contained and does not require a separate .NET runtime. Maya is not bundled and remains an external requirement for FBX conversion.
- Build telemetry is disabled in verification to keep restricted and CI runs deterministic.

## Remaining production gate

No implementation phase remains on the test branch. Production migration waits only for the final .NET 11 SDK, an updated dependency audit, a repeat of all 32 engine/Maya checks, Native AOT startup/UI Automation checks on the GA runtime, and explicit approval to merge. Until then, WPF v1.1.9 remains the supported release.
