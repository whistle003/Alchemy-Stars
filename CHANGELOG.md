# Changelog

## 1.3.0-preview.9 — 2026-09-06

- Added a fixed first-person CAST preview camera matching Maya transform `T(0,0,0)`, `R(90°,0°,-90°)`, with a 90° horizontal FOV and 0.1 near clip. The camera toolbar toggle, `1` shortcut, localized state badge and accessibility name keep orbit and first-person modes explicit.
- Made animation-track bars read each source CAST asynchronously and scale to its true frame count. The shared frame range also reflects positive and negative layer offsets; frame-count labels, localized tooltips and UI Automation names supplement the visual length encoding.
- Set merged skinned CAST meshes to Dual Quaternion (`quaternion`) skinning. The bundled Maya importer now defaults older meshes without an explicit skinning method to DQS while continuing to honor explicit methods.
- Added pure layout, canonical Hawk metadata, Native AOT UI Automation geometry and merged-output DQS regressions. The standard Hawk project visibly resolves to 1-frame idle, 67-frame sprint-loop and 1-frame additive-offset tracks.

## 1.3.0-preview.8 — 2026-09-06

- Localized every workspace context-menu command through the active UI language. Animation, animation-layer, model-part and CAST framing menus now show Chinese or English exclusively and update with the global language switch.
- Added localization contract checks so bilingual hard-coded menu labels cannot silently return.

## 1.3.0-preview.7 — 2026-09-06

- Rebuilt the supplied reference's panel geometry: a 48 DIP activity rail, resizable library/viewport/inspector, a full-width lower layer area, and flat collapsible properties.
- Replaced project-toolbar glyphs with distinct, padded 24 DIP vectors while retaining 44 DIP hit targets and localized accessibility names; render smoke checks include stroke-bound clipping assertions.
- Added a real read-only merged CAST preview, backed by the existing exporter and sampler: clay-shaded meshes, skinned animation, playback/frame scrubbing, orbit/zoom, subject/all-geometry framing and skeleton overlay. Curve-only CAST can use the matching current-project skeleton, with an explicit bind-pose compatibility notice.
- Build-preview caches are uniquely scoped and cleaned after loading; successful CAST exports load the selected output automatically. Preview work runs off the UI thread and does not modify source assets, output settings or the conversion algorithm.
- The interrupted frame-ruler experiment was withdrawn. Layer bars describe composition order, while the preview's frame slider reads the loaded CAST's actual animation.
- Kept this work on the Avalonia Native AOT test branch; no stable release or GitHub publication is included.

## 1.3.0-preview.6 — 2026-09-05

- Rebuilt the Avalonia workspace from the supplied Beutl editor reference: project breadcrumbs, a compact activity rail, asset library, central composition canvas, animation-layer tracks and a dedicated property inspector.
- Adapted the reference to real Alchemy Stars workflows instead of adding placeholder playback or 3D controls; animation-layer drop priority, right-click import, editable paths and all export settings remain functional.
- Applied the same library/canvas/inspector grammar to model assembly and retained 44 DIP command targets, keyboard focus, screen-reader names and owner-centered dialogs.

## 1.3.0-preview.5 — 2026-09-05

- Reworked the Avalonia shell into a Beutl-inspired creative workbench: compact activity rail, flat dock-like asset and property panels, low-noise dividers, active-tab accent lines and a full-width status strip.
- Kept AtomBox-informed 20/14 DIP form spacing, compact lists and restrained control surfaces while avoiding new AtomUI, Beutl or Dock.Avalonia dependencies in the Native AOT package.
- Raised essential input/control boundaries to 3:1 non-text contrast, retained 44 DIP command targets, localized UI Automation names, visible keyboard focus and centered window-owned dialogs.

## 1.3.0-preview.4 — 2026-09-05

- Introduced a resource-list/inspector workspace and consolidated shared visual tokens while evaluating the Lunacy and AtomBox references.
- Added page-level project context, compact command actions and scroll-safe settings/About layouts without changing the export workflow.

## 1.3.0-preview.3 — 2026-09-05

- Replaced ambiguous filled toolbar glyphs with a consistent 20 DIP, 1.8 DIP rounded-stroke icon family for New, Open, Save, Save As, Export and primary navigation.
- Preserved 44 × 44 DIP command targets, visible tooltips and localized UI Automation names so the icon-only commands remain keyboard- and screen-reader-accessible.
- Added an external Windows UI Automation smoke test that verifies required button names, keyboard focus, centered-dialog focus and minimum key-target bounds against the published Native AOT executable.

## 1.3.0-preview.2 — 2026-09-05

- Completed the Avalonia vertical workflow: legacy-compatible project open/save, model parts, base animations, poses, ordered layers, IK, output settings, remembered directories and batch export.
- Added source-generated AOT-safe JSON metadata for existing `.aprj` files, including old `$id` / `$values` reference-preserved projects.
- Added system file dialogs, editable and pasteable path fields, direct file drops, blank-area right-click imports and a dedicated animation-layer drop target that takes priority over its parent page.
- Kept new output folders blank and added a final engine guard that rejects any output path matching a model, animation, layer or pose input.
- Added full-scene and animation-only CAST, FBX, SMD and SEAnim controls, selective-bone baking, system/Chinese/English language modes, centered in-window progress/result dialogs and an unclipped About page.
- Extended acceptance coverage to 32 checks and added an actual Native AOT export from the standard Hawk project. The managed and AOT CAST files remain byte-identical.

## 1.3.0-preview.1 — 2026-09-05

- Added a test-only Avalonia 12.1.2 desktop shell that publishes as a 38 MB-class self-contained Native AOT package on .NET 11 Preview 7, including Skia, HarfBuzz and ANGLE rendering libraries.
- Introduced the WPF-free `IAnimationExportEngine` seam, immutable export requests, capability discovery, and structured validation errors.
- Reused the single proven conversion implementation across the WPF and AOT adapters, retaining CAST, FBX, SMD, SEAnim, IK, animation layers, selective baking, and animation-only CAST.
- Added a Native AOT contract self-test, deterministic real-window startup regression, off-screen UI rendering, and direct AOT Hawk export verification.
- Verified the new engine against the standard Hawk idle-plus-two-additive-layers recipe; Native AOT and managed CAST outputs are byte-identical.
- Kept the existing WPF application and production release line unchanged. This preview is a migration milestone, not a stable release.

## 1.2.0-preview.1 — 2026-09-05

- Created an isolated .NET 11 Preview test line; the production `main` branch and v1.1.9 release remain on .NET 9.
- Retargeted Alchemy Stars and its acceptance tests to `net11.0`; the pinned upstream RedFox submodule remains untouched and runs as a compatible .NET 9 library on the .NET 11 runtime.
- Pinned .NET SDK `11.0.100-preview.7.26381.103` with preview opt-in for reproducible testing.
- Display the full informational version so test builds are visibly identified as `1.2.0-preview.1`.
- Keep the preview package framework-dependent after .NET 11 disallowed compressed framework-dependent single-file bundles; ZIP distribution remains compressed and no runtime is bundled.
- Create validated archive subdirectories on first use so preview packages can remain separated from stable release assets.
- This branch is not a production release. It will move to .NET 11 GA only after Microsoft publishes the final SDK and the full Maya 2025 regression suite passes.

## 1.1.9 — 2026-09-05

- Fixed the partially clipped About icon with explicit icon sizing and padding. The toolbar now overflows before reaching the protected language/About controls.
- Improved dark-theme icon and format-selection contrast, restored themed text inputs, and added accessible names to inline icon buttons.
- Reflowed animation layers into separate path and operation rows. Animation and model columns adapt to window width; narrow windows scroll instead of crushing controls.
- Arranged output formats in a readable two-column grid and kept settings, About, and message dialogs within their owner window, with scrollable content and fixed actions.
- Added bilingual empty-list import hints, full-path tooltips, and a text-editing shortcut guard. Corrected the export tooltip to describe the existing whole-project export behavior.
- Added real-WPF layout regression checks and renders for Chinese/English at 900, 1100, 1366, and 1920 DIPs, including icon bounds, dialog content, dropdowns, and keyboard-editing isolation.

## 1.1.8 — 2026-09-05

- Fixed weapon offsets caused by collapsing a weapon-root `j_gun` into the view-hands wrist helper. Bone reuse now requires a matching parent and bind transform; distinct bones receive stable unique names.
- Sampling, CAST bones, mesh weights and hash references now use one merge plan. The weapon root `j_gun__weapon` follows `tag_weapon` while hand animation still targets the wrist helper `j_gun`.
- Empty weapon parents resolve to a unique `tag_weapon`; missing or ambiguous parents/animation targets produce actionable errors. Explicit parents remain honored.
- Corrected the Hawk examples to use `tag_weapon`. Re-export old merged scenes; animation-only files require the matching new skeleton.
- Corrected rigid mesh alignment for rotated, non-zero source roots and improved SMD Euler conversion precision near 90-degree pitch.
- Added 1911/P27/Hawk regression checks for weapon ancestry, skin weights and world-space playback, including separate-source Maya comparisons and full/selective/animation-only CAST, FBX and SMD.
- Updated English/Chinese guides and About content. The original MP5 example files remain unchanged.

## 1.1.7 — 2026-09-05

- Left the output folder blank for every newly imported animation, requiring an explicit destination before export so a same-named CAST cannot silently overwrite its source.
- Kept explicitly selected output folders stable when replacing an animation source and preserved saved destinations when loading existing projects.
- Added focused acceptance coverage for new imports, source replacement, and project round trips.

## 1.1.6 — 2026-09-05

- Added direct Explorer file drops to every editable source-path field; all file drops targeted at a field—including rejected types—stop there instead of bubbling into the surrounding animation, layer, or model import list.
- Output-folder fields accept either a folder or a file (using its containing folder), and successful field drops update the corresponding remembered directory.
- Added acceptance coverage for CAST filtering, folder resolution, and quoted clipboard paths.

## 1.1.5 — 2026-09-04

- Restored direct editing and clipboard paste support for animation, pose, animation-layer, model-part, and output-folder paths while retaining every file-browser button.
- Trimmed surrounding whitespace and matching quotes on focus loss, so paths copied with Windows **Copy as path** are accepted without manual cleanup.
- Added UI automation coverage for editable, keyboard-focusable, screen-reader-named path fields and quoted-path normalization.

## 1.1.4 — 2026-09-04

- Replaced the narrow output-format drop-down with four direct, keyboard-focusable radio options so the popup can no longer detach, shrink, or cover help text.
- Reflowed output settings into a responsive two-column card layout and increased the adaptive dialog height; scrolling now appears only when the window or localized content genuinely needs it.
- Extended UI automation to verify all four format choices, focusability, minimum target height, dialog containment, and the non-overlapping IK fields.

## 1.1.3 — 2026-09-04

- Redesigned the Output and IK settings dialog with grouped cards, explicit field labels, consistent spacing, and scroll-safe layout.
- Removed overlapping floating IK labels and added unique accessibility names plus predictable keyboard order for all eight IK fields.
- Expanded UI smoke coverage for label/input separation, minimum input height, bilingual content, and output-option toggles.

## 1.1.2 — 2026-09-04

- Added an optional relevant-bones-only bake for CAST, FBX, and SEAnim pipelines.
- Retains all base-animation, pose, layer, IK-chain, and indirectly changed bones; unknown solvers safely fall back to a full bake.
- Keeps compatibility mode as the default and documents the matching-bind-pose requirement for animation-only imports.
- Added full-versus-selective curve comparison and separate Maya 2025 validation; Hawk sprint retains 121 of 214 bones.
- Added global and project-level persistence plus bilingual, accessible settings UI.

## 1.1.1 — 2026-09-04

- Added optional animation-only CAST output containing one merged, baked animation without model geometry, materials, or skinning.
- Preserved full-scene CAST as the default and stored the option globally and in `.aprj` projects.
- Added animation-only CAST structure and weapon-curve acceptance coverage.

## 1.1.0 — 2026-09-04

Compared with upstream Alchemist, this release keeps its animation-layer and RedFox pipeline while adding a verified single-skeleton Maya package, direct SMD, Maya-backed FBX, safer import UX, persistent folders, and a complete bilingual release workflow.

- Added real FBX export through the locally installed Autodesk Maya FBX plug-in.
- Added native SMD animation export with complete skeleton hierarchy and per-frame transforms.
- Added `.cast`, `.fbx`, `.smd`, and `.seanim` default-format selection.
- Added automatic system-language detection plus Follow System, Simplified Chinese, and English choices.
- Added persistent recent folders for animations, layers, models, projects, and output.
- Redesigned the settings dialog to prevent clipping and protected the language/About controls from toolbar overlap.
- Updated About content and Hawk validation for CAST, FBX, SMD, skinning, and weapon motion.
- Kept the Windows x64 package framework-dependent; no .NET or Maya runtime is bundled.

## 1.0.3

- Redesigned toolbar icons to match their actions.
- Prioritized external file drops over the hovered animation-layer region.

## 1.0.2

- Fixed merged Maya animation output, including weapon animation and single-skeleton import.

## 1.0.0

- Initial Alchemy Stars release based on Scobalula/Alchemist.
